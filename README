bean-seal is a simple library that creates digests of objects based on a
description of their classes.

// Assume Customer is a described class, with 'customerNo' as a @Sealed property.
Customer c = new Customer("John", "Doe", "123-ABC");

DiscreteAnnotationCalculator calc = new DiscreteAnnotationCalculator();
Option<Map<String, String>> map = calc.calculate(c);

System.out.println(map.some());
// Output: {customerNo=682f6a9cf68c60e947f00be8007abf5857ac9e70}
